#AZ-104 ARM Template – Highly Available Windows VM

“I built this template while preparing for AZ-104 to solidify my understanding of Availability Sets and ARM dependencies.

This project contains an **Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template** that deploys a **highly available Windows Virtual Machine** using an **Availability Set**, along with required networking and security components.

It is designed to demonstrate core skills required for the **AZ-104: Microsoft Azure Administrator** certification.

##What This Template Deploys

- **Windows Server 2019 Virtual Machine**
- **Availability Set** (fault & update domains)
- **Virtual Network & Subnet**
- **Network Security Group (NSG)** with RDP access
- **Network Interface (NIC)**
- **Public IP Address**
- **Managed OS Disk**
- **Parameterized deployment** for reuse
